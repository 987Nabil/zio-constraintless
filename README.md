A discussion on http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~wlj05/files/Deconstraining.pdf as Scala code


"The key principle that underpins our idea is that implementation- specific constraints should be imposed at the point of use of a data type, not at the point of definition, i.e. it embodies the established principle that an interface should be separated from its implementation(s)."


Refer Expr.scala, the types can be a typelevel proofs **may** be readable only when readers try themselves. But it is mostly write once and forget.
