Allows you to build programs as mere descriptions with maximum polymorphism, maximum modularity, zero abstraction leakage, and zero casting.

It is **a Scala take on the following paper in Haskell, on parametrizing the program with logical constraints at every node, without compromising modularity**

An excerpt from the paper:


_"The key principle that underpins our idea is that implementation- specific constraints should be imposed at the point of use of a data type, not at the point of definition, i.e. it embodies the established principle that an interface should be separated from its implementation(s)."_
